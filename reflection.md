App Reflection
================


### App capabilities:

- The app uses three different tabs to help studying the change in the job market, while highlighting the differences for both genders; males and females.

- The first tab addresses the research question about how the count of different jobs changed over years using a heat map. By selecting a particular area over the heat map, that will select specific years and the jobs for which the user wants to see the employment count , the heat map will be zoomed over that specific part showing the difference  of counts only for the selected jobs and counts.

Also, by hovering over the heat map, user can get additional information like exact count , year and the job.

- In the second tab, the app shows how the trend of various jobs changed over years by allowing the user to select any job from the drop down.

- The third tab concludes how the trend of different jobs changed over time for males and females.

### Limitations:

- The heat map just shows the total count of all the jobs for that year. It  does not show how that total job count is distributed among men and women. In future, we will add a bar graph that will change according the area on the heat map selected by the user showing the distribution of the count of jobs among males and females.

- The app only shows and studies 10 jobs, in the future version of the app, we will add a functionality to allow the user to select from a wider range of jobs.

- In this version (version 1.0) of the app, we didnâ€™t study the relationship between the different jobs; such as the increase in the total employments for a job that caused a decrease in another job.

- In the future versions of the dashboard, we will consider datasets from different countries, or continents and make comparisons between them.


### Addressing the Feedback

[Issue mentioned by TA](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/532_project_job_Analyzer_R/issues/3)

- As the TA mentioned in the issue, we added a description of the app at the beginning of the app.

- We started summarizing the task that has been done in the pull request.

- As mentioned by our peers, we added a title to the app.

- We corrected the size of the graphs and spacing of the app. Now, one graph is visible on only one page without any blank space below it.

- We removed the typos and spacing issues in the  earlier provided description of the app.
### Wishlist Features

- In the future we might add more functionalities to our "Gender ratio" tab so that users can see 	the gender ratio trend of each job upon their selection of the job.

- In the future we might use CSS to format our dashboard.

- We hope that in the future we would get a dataset that includes the data from the 1890s.
